    Our first step in this case will be to consider the overall scope of
    the application:
    • What is it for?
    • Does it allow user registration?
    • Does it have an administration panel?
    • Does it take input from the user?
    • What kind of input?
    • Does it accept file uploads?
    • Does it use JavaScript or Ajax or Flash? And so on.
    ```
